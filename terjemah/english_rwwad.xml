But I shall not treat him unless you reward us. We asked you for your hospitality and you refused!” They agreed to give us a herd of goats. So he went to him and recited Surat al-Fātihah and blew over him. The chief was invigorated and went on walking with no sign of ailment. They gave them the agreed reward. Some of the Companions said: “Let us divide it!” Others said: “Do not, until you reach the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), tell him what has happened and see what he bids us do”. They went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him. He said: “How did you come to know that it can be used as ruqyah? You have done the right thing. Divide it and allocate a share for me” [al-Bukhārī: 5749; Muslim: 2201]. ‘Ā’ishah (رضي الله عنه) narrated that: “When ill, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite al-Mu‘awwidhāt (the Sheltering surahs, al-Falaq and al-Nās) and blow.

<footnotes><![CDATA[[1] This type of divorce is called zihār: a common practice in Arabia before the Prophet (ﷺ). If someone declared his wife as unlawful for him as the zahr (back) of his mother is unlawful for him, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished this divorce. Allah says: “As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers, they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them.” See 58:2.
 [2] Adoption of a child or an orphan is not permissible by ascribing the child to other than their real parents. Whereas, it is permissible for one to sponsor a child or host them in their home and care for them as they care for their own children, except for legal matters.]]></footnotes>

The Prophet (ﷺ) had anticipated the offense and, upon advice from one of his companions, Salmān from Persia, dug a trench around the city to protect it from the invaders. After several attempts to cross the trench, the Allied forces lost morale and were forced to end the siege due to severe weather conditions. By this Allah saved Muslims from the machination of the non-Muslim allied forces to destroy the newly-born Islamic community in Madinah.
